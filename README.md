## Features include:
* **Customisable lighting**

  A shadow tone map system is integrated, which allows for true anime-style material shade colouring and light bias. 
  Provides a light ramp system that are integrated seamlessly into lighting. 
  Or, use the Crosstone system and define multiple shadow tones.
  All integrated with Unity's lighting system!

* **NPR**

  SCSS contains a unique matcap system. You can combine multiple blend modes and multiple matcaps. They can be anchored in world or tangent space, stopping them from shifting with head movement in VR. 
  Customisable ambient and emissive rim lights are also provided for shine effects. 
  Cel-shaded specular gives you a stylised shiny highlight.

* **PBR**

  Contains metalness and smoothness functionality accurate to Unity's Standard shader. You can combine a cel-shaded material with realistic metal and gloss. 
  Detail maps are supported, allowing you to give materials a realistic fine texture close-up.

* **Outlines and control**

  The outline system is optimised for VR, with outlines that reduce size based on camera proximity to avoid models breaking up at close inspection. And outline size can be finely controlled using the vertex colour channels. 

* **Advanced Options**

  Many advanced options for blend mode and more. Provides support for using premutiplied transparency,   which allows for glossy transparent objects that naturally fit into their surroundings.
