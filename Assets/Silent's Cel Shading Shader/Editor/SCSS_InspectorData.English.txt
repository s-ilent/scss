_LightWrappingCompensationFactor	Light Reduction	Compensation factor for the light wrapping inherent in cel shading. For cel shaded models, this should be around 0.75. Realistic lighting should set this to 1 to disable it.
_IndirectShadingType	Indirect Shading Type	Sets the method used to shade indirect lighting. Directional will pick a single direction as a fake light source, so light will always be sharp. Dynamic will use the overall shading as a base, allowing for blobbier and more accurate lighting.
_UseAnimation	Animation	Enables the spritesheet system, where textures provided to the shader are divided into sections and displayed seperately over time.
