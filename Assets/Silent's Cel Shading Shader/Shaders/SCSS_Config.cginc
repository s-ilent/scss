#define SCSS_CLAMP_IN_NON_HDR 1

// When screen-space shadows are used in the scene, performs a
// search to find the best sampling point for the shadow
// using the camera's depth buffer. This filters away many aliasing
// artifacts caused by limitations in the screen shadow technique
// used by directional lights.
#define SCSS_SCREEN_SHADOW_FILTER 1

// As objects become further and further from the origin point
// (0, 0, 0) in world space, they become affected by the 
// limitations of precision in floating point numbers.
// For shaders, this manifests as polygons wobbling and warping
// as they are further away from the origin point.
// This setting enables a system that calculates the final placement
// of polygons on screen seperately from their world-space
// position, partly alleviating this issue. However, it interferes
// with some of Unity's systems that expect the result of the
// object to world transformation to be identical between shaders. 
//#define SCSS_CAMERA_RELATIVE_VERTEX 1

// When objects reach the nearest extent of the camera's frustrum,
// they can intersect it and clip through. In VR, this can be a 
// problem as frustrum extents which are suitable for most circumstances
// will fall apart when close to an object - or, more commonly, another
// person. This setting enables a tweak to squish objects before they can
// intersect with the frustrum, giving them the appearance of a
// closer clipping plane on the camera.
